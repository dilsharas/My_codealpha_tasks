## 📌 **Task 1: Phishing Awareness Training**  

### 🎯 **Objective**  
Educate users on identifying phishing attempts through a training module with real-world examples and best practices.

### 🔍 **Key Features**  
- ✅ Red flags in phishing emails (e.g., urgency, mismatched URLs).  
- ✅ Side-by-side comparisons of real vs. phishing emails.  
- ✅ Interactive quiz to test knowledge.  

### 🛠️ **Tools Used**  
- PowerPoint/Canva  
- [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com/) for example datasets

## 📌 **Task 2: Secure Code Review**  

### 🎯 **Objective**  
Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in code using static analysis and manual review.

### 🔍 **Key Findings**  
- **SQL Injection**: Found in raw SQL queries → Fixed with parameterized queries.  
- **XSS**: Unsanitized user input → Mitigated using HTML escaping.  
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: API keys exposed → Moved to environment variables.  

### 🛠️ **Tools Used**  
- Bandit (Python)

## 📌 **Task 3: Basic Packet Sniffer (Python)**  

### 🎯 **Objective**  
Capture and analyze network traffic to understand packet structures and detect anomalies.

### 🔍 **Key Features**  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Filters TCP/UDP/HTTP traffic.  
- 📊 Logs source/destination IPs and ports.  
- ⚠️ Flags unusual activity (e.g., rapid port scans).  

### 🛠️ **Tools Used**  
- Python 3 + Scapy  
- Wireshark (for validation)
